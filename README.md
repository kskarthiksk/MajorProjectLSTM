This is a repository for my Projects in college that I did along with my classmate. The project was "Classification Of EEG Signals Of Schizophrenia Patients, Depression Patients And Healthy Controls Using Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)"

The EEG data of all 3 groups were processed and features like Approximate Entropy, Hurst Exponent, Detrended Fluctuation, Spectral Entropy etc were extracted from the data.

This was then used for classification using a neural network (LSTM).

__LSTM - 2 way classification.ipynb__ is a 2 way classifier that classifies data from Schizophrenia patients and healthy individuals.

__LSTM - 3 way classification.ipynb__ is a 3 way classifier between data from Schizophrenia patients, Depression Patients and Healthy Controls.

__k-fold-cross.ipynb__ is the 5-fold cross validated version of LSTM - 3 way classification.ipynb.

We presented a conference paper for the 2 way classification at MOSICOM 2020, BITS Pilani Dubai Campus and it was published in [Advances in Machine Learning and Computational Intelligence‚Äù pp 229-236](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-15-5243-4_19)
